This is currently a work in progress

What I learned so far:
- How to handle multiple arguments using functions from stdarg.h
- How to set up functions pointers in a hash table (sort of, it's a baby hash table)
- That information parsing can be one of the biggest pains in the world
- I am developing a very strong coffee addiction #DrinkCoffeeSoICanCode #CodeSoICanBuyMoreCoffee

So far this project is not too bad. It's a lot of the basics again but this is one project that requires a good design plan.
